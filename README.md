### Source Code

In the IDE, once an image is selected for a form's (or picturebox) picture property, I never knew how to delete it, except by copying all the controls on the form, opening a new form, pasting, then deleting the old form. I never took the time to try to figure out a quicker way. To do it, you can just put the cursor on the '(picture)' text in the properties window, and hit the delete key. Well, I impressed myself, anyway...And my mom thinks I'm smart too.
